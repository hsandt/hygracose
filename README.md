Hybrid Graph-Constrained Search

This repository was meant to extract generic graph-constrained search from my 2D Polygon Packing program, but I ended up publishing the application as one repository. See the [hipps repository](https://github.com/hsandt/hipps) for more information, and actual code on the [ippy repository on BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/hsandt/ippy).
